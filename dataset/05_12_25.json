    "raw_text": "You guys, the EU is absolutely not messing around with Mark Zuckerberg today. So, Meta has this plan to basically lock down WhatsApp so that *only* their AI can live there, effectively blocking any rival bots from the platform. Well, the European Commission just launched a massive antitrust probe this morning to stop that dead in its tracks. They're arguing that this creates an unfair monopoly on the world's biggest messaging app. The crazy part? They aren't just investigating; they are considering 'interim measures' to physically stop Meta from flipping the switch while the investigation is ongoing. This is a huge showdown over who actually owns the 'intelligence' in your pocket—Meta, or you?",
