    "title": "Meta Drops $2 Billion to Build the Ultimate Super-App",
    "summary": "Meta has acquired AI startup Manus for $2 billion to integrate autonomous agent capabilities into WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. The move aims to transform these platforms into 'super-apps' capable of executing complex tasks like travel booking directly within the chat interface.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop scrolling for a second because Zuck just made a massive move. Meta reportedly just dropped two billion dollars—yes, with a 'B'—to acquire a startup called Manus. Here’s why this matters: We all know LLaMA is smart, right? It’s a great brain. But it has no hands. It can write you a poem, but it can’t book your flight. Manus changes that. They specialize in 'agentic AI,' which means software that actually *does* stuff. The plan is to plug this into WhatsApp and turn it into a WeChat-style Super App. Imagine texting 'Book me a flight to Tokyo' and it just happens. No apps, no websites. But here’s the spicy part: Manus had to cut all ties with its Chinese investors just to get the deal through US regulators. The AI wars are getting geopolitical, guys.",

    "title": "OpenAI's Strategic Capture: The End of OpenClaw?",
    "summary": "OpenAI has hired Peter Steinberger, creator of the popular open-source agent framework OpenClaw, and is transitioning the project into a foundation. This strategic hire is seen as a move to capture the 'personal agent' interface layer and steer developers away from rival models like Anthropic's Claude.",

    "raw_text": "If you're a dev, you know OpenClaw. It’s that open-source tool everyone was using to build AI agents, and frankly, it worked really well with Anthropic’s Claude. Well, Sam Altman just said 'Yoink!' OpenAI hired the creator, Peter Steinberger, and brought the whole project in-house. They say it’s staying open-source, but let’s be real—this is a power play. OpenAI wants to own the 'OS' of AI. They don't just want to be the chatbot; they want to be the layer that controls your computer. By hiring the guy who built the best agent framework, they basically just flipped the default switch from Claude to GPT. It’s a brilliant, ruthless move to dominate the agentic future.",

Basically, usually, if you visit a bad website, the damage is contained in the browser tab. This bug lets the bad code jump out of the browser and take over your actual computer. If you're on Windows or Mac, you need version 145.0.7632.75 immediately. Don't wait on this one, folks. Security is no joke in 2026.",

The US Department of Defense is already migrating their tech, but Bitcoin moves slowly.
