The move aims to transform these platforms into 'super-apps' capable of executing complex tasks like travel booking directly within the chat interface.",

Here\u2019s why this matters: We all know LLaMA is smart, right? It\u2019s a great brain. But it has no hands. It can write you a poem, but it can\u2019t book your flight. Manus changes that. They specialize in 'agentic AI,' which means software that actually *does* stuff. The plan is to plug this into WhatsApp and turn it into a WeChat-style Super App. Imagine texting 'Book me a flight to Tokyo' and it just happens. No apps, no websites. But here\u2019s the spicy part: Manus had to cut all ties with its Chinese investors just to get the deal through US regulators. The AI wars are getting geopolitical, guys.",
