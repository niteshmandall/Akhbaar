Check this out: a new open-source agent called Moltbot\u2014originally Clawdbot before Anthropic got mad\u2014just went absolutely viral. Unlike ChatGPT where you talk back and forth, Moltbot just *does* stuff. It's triaging inboxes, booking flights, and writing code on its own. It's basically the first AI intern that actually works. And here's the wild part\u2014this thing is generating so much traffic that it literally pumped Cloudflare's stock by 12% in a single day because all these local agents need secure tunnels to hit the internet. If you aren't looking into 'local-first' AI agents yet, you are falling behind. This is the new operating system.",
