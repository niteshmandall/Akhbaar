    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you're doing because NVIDIA just dropped a bombshell that changes the entire AI game. We're talking about the new 'Rubin' platform. Jensen Huang revealed this beast at CES, and it\u2019s not just a faster GPU\u2014it\u2019s a literal six-chip supercomputer named after astronomer Vera Rubin. Here\u2019s the wild part: they aren't just focusing on training models anymore; they are going all-in on *inference*. Why does this matter? Because running those smart AI agents we all want has been insanely expensive. Rubin slashes that cost by 10x. Ten times cheaper! This means we\u2019re finally going to see those 'always-on' AI assistants that don't bankrupt the companies running them. It features a new 'Vera CPU' dedicated entirely to agentic reasoning. Honestly, this is the hardware moment we've been waiting for.",
