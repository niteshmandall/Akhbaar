    "summary": "Google has released Gemini 3 'Deep Think', a model that utilizes a System 2 thinking process to achieve a massive 84.6% on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark. The model can pause, simulate outcomes, and self-correct, marking a shift from pattern matching to genuine reasoning.",

    "raw_text": "Stop what you are doing. Google just effectively solved the 'Reasoning Gap.' We aren't talking about a chatbot that hallucinates citations anymore. Gemini 3 'Deep Think' just dropped, and it hit an 84.6% on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark. For context, GPT-5.1 was stuck in the 60s. This thing isn't just predicting the next word; it's using 'System 2' thinking\u2014literally pausing to simulate potential futures and correct itself before it answers you. It's the difference between a reflex and a thought. If you're a developer or a researcher, the game just changed overnight. This is the closest we've ever been to AGI.",
