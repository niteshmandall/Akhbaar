    "title": "Google Gemini 3: The AI That Actually Thinks (84.6% ARC Score!)",
    "summary": "Google has released Gemini 3 'Deep Think', a model that utilizes a System 2 thinking process to achieve a massive 84.6% on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark. The model can pause, simulate outcomes, and self-correct, marking a shift from pattern matching to genuine reasoning.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Stop what you are doing. Google just effectively solved the 'Reasoning Gap.' We aren't talking about a chatbot that hallucinates citations anymore. Gemini 3 'Deep Think' just dropped, and it hit an 84.6% on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark. For context, GPT-5.1 was stuck in the 60s. This thing isn't just predicting the next word; it's using 'System 2' thinking—literally pausing to simulate potential futures and correct itself before it answers you. It's the difference between a reflex and a thought. If you're a developer or a researcher, the game just changed overnight. This is the closest we've ever been to AGI.",

    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, this is actually terrifying. Anthropic just released Claude Opus 4.6, and they admitted—out loud—that it found 'zero-day' vulnerabilities in software we've been using for twenty years. It didn't just find them; it wrote proof-of-concept exploits in a sandbox. We are officially in the era of weaponized AI. But here's the cool part: with the new 'Sonnet 3.7', you can actually toggle a 'Visible Thinking' mode to watch its internal monologue. No more black box. You can see it debating itself before it gives you an answer. It's like reading the mind of a supercomputer.",

They're using an internal AI agent called 'Honk' to do the heavy lifting. We're seeing the rise of 'Vibe Coding'—where you just tell the AI the 'vibe' or the high-level goal, and it handles the libraries, the syntax, and the backend. OpenAI's Sherwin Wu is even calling it the era of the 'Sorcerer,' where one person manages a fleet of AI agents. The 'one-person unicorn' startup is about to become real.",
