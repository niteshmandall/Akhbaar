[cite: 57]\n\nHere's the wild part: we're running out of power on Earth for all these AI chips, right? So Elon's solution is to launch millions of servers into space. They're going to use the vacuum of space for cooling—which is free—and solar power for energy. It’s a closed-loop intelligence system orbiting the planet. Analysts are calling this a $1.25 trillion play. Honestly, this changes the entire infrastructure game. [cite_start]While we're worried about power grids failing, they're literally taking the cloud... into the actual clouds. [cite: 59, 62]",
