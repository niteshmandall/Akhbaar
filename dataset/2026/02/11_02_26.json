    "summary": "An open-source tool called OpenClaw (formerly ClawdBot) has gone viral, earning over 20,000 GitHub stars in a day. It enables AI agents to autonomously execute complex workflows across apps like WhatsApp and Slack, sparking a new development trend called \"Vibe Coding.\"",

    "raw_text": "Stop what you are doing. We might be looking at the 'ChatGPT moment' for AI agents. A new open-source tool called OpenClaw just dropped, and it is absolutely blowing up—we're talking 20,000 GitHub stars in 24 hours. So, what does it do? Unlike a chatbot that just talks, OpenClaw actually *does* things. It connects to your WhatsApp, Slack, and local files to automate entire workflows. It’s model-agnostic, privacy-focused, and it's fueling a crazy new trend called 'Vibe Coding'—where you just describe the 'vibe' of an app you want, and the AI builds it. SaaS companies like Monday.com are tanking because investors think this tool might make paid software obsolete. If you're a developer, you need to look at this now.",

    "summary": "OpenAI has begun testing advertisements within ChatGPT for free-tier users in the US. The ads are clearly labeled and do not influence the AI's answers, marking a major shift toward a hybrid revenue model to subsidize compute costs.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "It’s finally happening. The ads are coming to ChatGPT. OpenAI just confirmed they are testing ads for free users in the US. Now, before you panic—they promise the advertisers can't influence the actual answers. The ads just show up around the chat. But let's be real, this is a huge shift. They have 800 million weekly users and running those servers costs a fortune, so they are pivoting to a hybrid model: pay with your wallet for Pro, or pay with your attention for Free. It puts them in direct competition with Google Search. Are you sticking with the free version, or is this the push you needed to upgrade?",

    "raw_text": "Bad news if you were waiting for the 'iPhone of AI.' We just got confirmation that OpenAI's secret hardware project with Jony Ive is delayed. We all thought we’d see it this year, but court filings just revealed it won't ship until at least February 2027. That is a massive delay. Building 'physical AI' is apparently way harder than just releasing a model. This gives Apple and Google a huge window to dominate the AI device market before OpenAI even shows up. Honestly, by 2027, will we even need a dedicated AI device, or will our glasses already do everything?",
