    "raw_text": "Stop what you are doing. We might be looking at the 'ChatGPT moment' for AI agents. A new open-source tool called OpenClaw just dropped, and it is absolutely blowing up\u2014we're talking 20,000 GitHub stars in 24 hours. So, what does it do? Unlike a chatbot that just talks, OpenClaw actually *does* things. It connects to your WhatsApp, Slack, and local files to automate entire workflows. It\u2019s model-agnostic, privacy-focused, and it's fueling a crazy new trend called 'Vibe Coding'\u2014where you just describe the 'vibe' of an app you want, and the AI builds it. SaaS companies like Monday.com are tanking because investors think this tool might make paid software obsolete. If you're a developer, you need to look at this now.",

They have 800 million weekly users and running those servers costs a fortune, so they are pivoting to a hybrid model: pay with your wallet for Pro, or pay with your attention for Free. It puts them in direct competition with Google Search. Are you sticking with the free version, or is this the push you needed to upgrade?",
