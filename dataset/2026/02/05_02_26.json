    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, this is hands down the biggest story of the decade. Elon Musk has officially merged his AI company, xAI, into SpaceX, creating a massive $1.25 trillion juggernaut. Why? Because running AI on Earth is becoming a nightmare due to power shortages and heat. Musk\u2019s solution is literally 'Space-Based AI.' The plan is to use over 8,000 Starlink satellites as a laser-connected mesh network to host orbital data centers. Imagine training the next Grok model in space, cooled by the vacuum of the void, and beaming the intelligence down to Earth. This totally flips the script on Musk\u2019s empire\u2014SpaceX is now the main character, eclipsing Tesla. Investors are already losing their minds over a potential mega-IPO in June. We are officially entering the era of orbital intelligence.",

Jensen Huang is dropping a staggering $20 billion investment directly into OpenAI. This isn't just charity; it's a defensive power play. Rumors were flying that OpenAI was looking at AMD or building their own chips. Nvidia just shut that down. By owning a chunk of OpenAI, they guarantee their GPUs stay in the racks for the next generation of models like GPT-6. Plus, Nvidia now gets a cut of the profit every time you use ChatGPT. This is vertical integration on steroids, and it solidifies Nvidia's stranglehold on the AI industry.",
