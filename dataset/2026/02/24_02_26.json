I mean, think about the sheer scale of this. Much of this fresh capital is going right back into buying Nvidia's chips to train even crazier models. It is literally a feedback loop of infinite tech power! If you thought ChatGPT was already mind-blowing, just wait until they have an extra thirty billion dollars of compute throwing its weight around. We are witnessing the tech ecosystem merging into this absolute juggernaut of AI dominance.
