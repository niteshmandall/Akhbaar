    "raw_text": "Okay, Elon Musk just completely flipped the script. We\u2019ve been hearing 'Mars, Mars, Mars' for years, right? Well, reports today say SpaceX is pivoting its immediate focus to building a 'self-growing city' on the Moon first. He wants this done in less than a decade. But that\u2019s not even the wildest part. Over at Tesla, they are pivoting hard. They\u2019re dumping $20 billion into capex this year, and almost all of it is for AI and the Optimus robot, not cars. Musk is literally calling Optimus a 'Von Neumann machine'\u2014which means a robot that can replicate itself and build civilization. He even wants to send them to Mars *before* humans to build the base. Critics say it\u2019s a massive cash burn, but if he pulls this off, we aren\u2019t just looking at a car company anymore; we\u2019re looking at the builders of the next world.",

The idea is to move away from doom-scrolling and screens to something more 'peaceful.' You just talk to it. It does real-time translation, fact-checking, and supposedly has high emotional intelligence. It\u2019s basically the movie 'Her' coming to life.

    "raw_text": "Samsung is getting weird with their displays, and I love it. They just launched a 13-inch color e-paper screen... made from algae. Specifically, 'phytoplankton bio-resin.' It\u2019s sustainable and low-power. But if you want something flashier, they also rolled out a new 'glasses-free 3D' screen for billboards and ads. It uses eye-tracking to give you a perfect 3D image without needing those goofy glasses. We're moving away from standard black mirrors to screens that are either eco-friendly or literally popping out at you.",

These aren't chatbots that just answer questions. These are 'agents' that can perform multi-step tasks, reconcile transactions, and do due diligence on their own. They had engineers embedded there for six months to build this. It\u2019s a huge signal that the biggest banks in the world are trusting AI with the sensitive stuff. If Goldman is trusting an agent with their compliance, the 'experimental' phase of AI is definitely over.",

This isn't just a partnership; it's a full merger to create an 'Orbital Compute' giant. The plan is to launch data centers into space. Why? Because space is cold (free cooling) and has unlimited solar power. They want to bypass the energy grid entirely. Analysts think this new company could be worth over a trillion dollars. It's the ultimate vertical integration: he builds the rockets, launches the servers, and owns the AI. If this works, the cloud is literally going to the stars.",

The model now pauses to think through hard problems before answering, similar to how human experts work. It\u2019s crushing benchmarks in coding and legal analysis.
