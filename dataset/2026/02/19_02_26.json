We just got confirmation of a 'Special Apple Experience' on March 4th, and the leaks are pointing to a completely new hardware category. We aren't just talking about a new iPhone; we're talking about 'Smart Glasses' and\u2014get this\u2014AirPods with built-in cameras. Yes, cameras in your ears. The concept is that Siri can 'see' what you're looking at and give you real-time answers without you ever pulling out your phone. It's the 'Iron Man' features we've been promised for years. If this is real, Apple is finally trying to kill the screen. Would you wear a camera in your ear, or is that a privacy nightmare? Let me know below.",

They claim that 'infinite scroll' and 'auto-play' are defective product features engineered to create chemical dependency in your brain, exactly like nicotine in cigarettes.
