    "raw_text": "Okay, this is actually insane. Google just dropped \"Project Genie,\" and it\u2019s basically the end of game development as we know it. Imagine typing \"cyberpunk city with flying cars\" and boom\u2014you're not just getting a picture, you're getting a fully playable, explorable 3D world with physics and everything. The market completely freaked out. Stocks for Roblox, Unity, and Take-Two tanked between 10% and 21% instantly. Why? Because if anyone can generate a AAA-level game environment in seconds, the whole industry model breaks. Developers are terrified, but honestly, for gamers? This could be the coolest toy ever created. We are officially entering the era of 'dream it, play it.'",
