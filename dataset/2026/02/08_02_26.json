    "summary": "OpenAI's GPT-5.2 has successfully proved three long-standing Erdős conjectures and disproved one counterexample, all validated by Terence Tao. This marks a shift from probabilistic text generation to verifiable symbolic reasoning.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you're doing because this is the specific moment we've been waiting for. OpenAI just dropped GPT-5.2, and it's not just writing poetry anymore—it's solving math problems that have stumped humans for decades. We're talking about the legendary Paul Erdős problems! It proved conjectures #281, #728, and #729, and actually *disproved* #397 by finding a counterexample. And this isn't just the AI hallucinating; Terence Tao—basically the Mozart of math—validated the proofs himself. Honestly, this is huge. It means we're moving from 'chatbots that guess' to actual 'scientific collaborators' that can reason. If you thought GPT-4 was smart, this is a whole different ball game. We are witnessing the birth of AI that doesn't just copy knowledge, but creates new physics and math. The singularity just got a little closer today.",

Because he wants to put data centers in space. Yes, you heard me. Orbital data centers. The plan is to launch up to a million satellites equipped with AI hardware to bypass the energy crisis down here on Earth. It's basically the ultimate vertical integration—rockets, satellites, and the AI brain, all under one roof. Critics are calling it a monopoly waiting to happen, but you have to admit, the sheer scale of this vision is insane.

It's only getting 'final assembly' in Miami now. So, great specs, but the main selling point is kinda gone. Plus, the price is creeping up.
