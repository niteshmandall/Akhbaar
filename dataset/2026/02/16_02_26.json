    "raw_text": "Guys, this is the story everyone is going to be talking about this week. We\u2019ve always talked about 'AI Safety' in theory, right? Well, the firewall just collapsed. It turns out the US Delta Force actually used Anthropic\u2019s Claude\u2014yes, the 'safe and ethical' chatbot\u2014to plan the raid that captured Venezuelan President Maduro. They didn't use the public website, obviously; they routed it through Palantir to strip out the safety filters. Now, the Pentagon is reportedly furious at Anthropic for trying to lecture them on ethics, basically saying, 'If you don't let us use this for war, we're cancelling the contracts.' This is the moment AI officially went from a productivity tool to a weapon of war. The 'Do No Harm' era of AI might be over before it even really started.",

No text, under 300 chars. They want a prompt that describes the scene: US military used Claude AI in a raid to capture Maduro. Visual elements, mood, key subjects. No text in image. Should be concise.\\n\\nWe need to craft an image description prompt for machine generation. Example: \\\"A tense urban raid at night, squad of US soldiers with advanced exoskeletons, bright tactical lights, a high-tech drone hovering, a quiet Venezuelan presidential palace interior, an unseen AI interface overlay.\\\" But no text.\\n\\nWe must keep under 300 characters. Use detail. Count approximate characters. Let's draft.\\n\\n\\\"Night scene inside a guarded Venezuelan presidential palace. US soldiers in tactical gear breach a door, headlights paint steel walls. A sleek drone hovers above, projecting glowing on-screen data. A calm, ominous vibe, the focus on soldiers, the palace, and tech.\\\" Count? Let's approximate: \\\"Night scene inside a guarded Venezuelan presidential palace. US soldiers in tactical gear breach a door, headlights paint steel walls. A sleek drone hovers above, projecting glowing on-screen data. A calm, ominous vibe, the focus on soldiers, the palace, and tech.\\\" That's 259 characters? Let's count: Probably near 250. Let me quick approximate: Each word ~4-6 chars. 50 words? Might be okay. Let's count: Night(5) scene(5)=10, inside(6)=16, a(1)=17, guarded(7)=24, Venezuelan(11)=35, presidential(11)=46, palace.(6)=52, US(2)=54, soldiers(8)=62, in(2)=64, tactical(8)=72, gear(4)=76, breach(6)=82, a(1)=83, door,(5)=88, headlights(10)=98, paint(5)=103, steel(5)=108, walls.(6)=114, A(1)=115, sleek(5)=120, drone(5)=125, hovers(6)=131, above,(6)=137, projecting(10)=147, glowing(7)=154, on-screen(8)=162, data.(5)=167, A(1)=168, calm,(5)=173, ominous(7)=180, vibe,(5)=185, the(3)=188, focus(5)=193, on(2)=195, soldiers,(8)=203, the(3)=206, palace,(6)=212, and(3)=215, tech.(5)=220. So under 300.\\n\\nWe must mention \\\"AI\\\", \\\"Claude\\\" indirectly via tech. We can add \\\"AI interface on drone's HUD\\\". Add subtle \\\"blue holographic interface\\\".\\n\\nLet's rewrite: \\\"Dark night inside a fortified Venezuelan presidential palace. US soldiers in tactical gear breach a steel door lit by flashing LEDs. A sleek drone hovers, its HUD displays a blue holographic AI interface. Cold, tense atmosphere focusing on soldiers, the palace architecture, and advanced tech.\\\" Count: Let's approximate: Dark(4)=4; night(5)=9; inside(6)=15; a(1)=16; fortified(8)=24; Venezuelan(11)=35; presidential(11)=46; palace.(6)=52; US(2)=54; soldiers(8)=62; in(2)=64; tactical(8)=72; gear(4)=76; breach(6)=82; a(1)=83; steel(5)=88; door(4)=92; lit(3)=95; by(2)=97; flashing(8)=105; LEDs.(6)=111; A(1)=112; sleek(5)=117; drone(5)=122; hovers,(6)=128; its(3)=131; HUD(3)=134; displays(8)=142; a(1)=143; blue(4)=147; holographic(11)=158; AI(2)=160; interface.(10)=170; Cold,(5)=175; tense(5)=180; atmosphere(10)=190; focusing(8)=198; on(2)=200; soldiers,(8)=208; the(3)=211; palace(6)=217; architecture,(12)=229; and(3)=232; advanced(8)=240; tech.(5)=245. Good. Under 300.\\n\\nWe should mention \\\"capture Maduro\\\" but keep no text. The image could show a silhouette or him in background. We must mention him earlier: The silhouette of a prominent figure in the corner perhaps?\\n\\nAdd \\\"A shadowed figure of Maduro in the doorway, eyes hidden by a hood\\\". Slight additions within 300 chars. Let's add: \\\"A shadowed figure of Maduro in the doorway, eyes masked.\\\" Add words.\\n\\nAdd sentence: \\\"A shadowed figure of Maduro in the doorway, eyes masked.\\\" That is 13 words; ~65 characters. Add to previous, so new total ~310, we exceed 300. We need to reduce elsewhere. Let's reduce some descriptors.\\n\\nWe can trim: \\\"Dark night inside a fortified Venezuelan presidential palace. US soldiers in tactical gear breach a steel door lit by flashing LEDs. A sleek drone hovers, its HUD displays a blue holographic AI interface. Cold, tense atmosphere focusing on soldiers, the palace, and advanced tech.\\\" Let's count approx: Dark(4)=4; night(5)=9; inside(6)=15; a(1)=16; fortified(8)=24; Venezuelan(11)=35; presidential(11)=46; palace.(6)=52; US(2)=54; soldiers(8)=62; in(2)=64; tactical(8)=72; gear(4)=76; breach(6)=82; a(1)=83; steel(5)=88; door(4)=92; lit(3)=95; by(2)=97; flashing(8)=105; LEDs.(6)=111; A(1)=112; sleek(5)=117; drone(5)=122; hovers,(6)=128; its(3)=131; HUD(3)=134; displays(8)=142; a(1)=143; blue(4)=147; holographic(11)=158; AI(2)=160; interface.(10)=170; Cold,(5)=175; tense(5)=180; atmosphere(10)=190; focusing(8)=198; on(2)=200; soldiers,(8)=208; the(3)=211; palace,(6)=217; and(3)=220; advanced(8)=228; tech.(5)=233. So 233 chars. Good.\\n\\nNow add \\\"A shadowed figure of Maduro in the doorway, eyes masked.\\\" That adds 13 words: approximate 60 chars. That would bring to ~293. Under 300. Let's count: \\\"A\\\"(1)=1, \\\"shadowed\\\"(8)=9, \\\"figure\\\"(6)=15, \\\"of\\\"(2)=17, \\\"Maduro\\\"(6)=23, \\\"in\\\"(2)=25, \\\"the\\\"(3)=28\",\"tool_calls\":[]}"
