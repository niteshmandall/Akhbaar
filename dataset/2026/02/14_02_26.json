But the valuation isn't even the crazy part. Leaked audio reveals they are planning to build AI data centers *in orbit* and\u2014get this\u2014a factory on the Moon. Yes, the actual Moon. They want to use a massive electromagnetic catapult called a 'mass driver' to shoot satellites from the lunar surface into orbit to save on fuel. It sounds like a movie script, but this is their actual roadmap to solve the energy crisis on Earth. While everyone else is fighting over GPU clusters here, Musk is literally leaving the planet. This is the definition of a 'Space-Based Industrial Complex.'",
