    "summary": "Oracle has announced a massive plan to raise $45-$50 billion in fiscal 2026 to fund AI infrastructure expansion. The capital is directly tied to 'contracted demand' from heavyweights like OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "We need to talk about the insane amount of money moving around today. Oracle just announced they are raising FIFTY BILLION dollars. That is not a typo. They are securing $50 billion in cash specifically to build AI data centers. Why? Because they literally cannot build them fast enough for their clients. They've got contracts with OpenAI, Meta, and xAI, and the demand for compute is so high they are basically printing debt to build the factories. This confirms that the AI hardware boom is nowhere near over. If you thought the infrastructure build-out was slowing down, Oracle just bet the entire company that it\u2019s just getting started.",
