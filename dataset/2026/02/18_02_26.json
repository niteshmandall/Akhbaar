    "raw_text": "Okay, we need to talk about the elephant in the room because Wall Street is officially freaking out. There's a rumor circulating today that Nvidia and OpenAI are looking at a $100 billion reciprocal deal. Basically, Nvidia gives OpenAI cash, and OpenAI gives it right back to buy chips. If this is true, it sounds a lot like the 'round-tripping' schemes we saw right before the dot-com crash. It inflates revenue on paper, but is the actual demand there? This is massive because if these two giants are propping each other up, the whole 'unlimited growth' narrative for AI might be built on shaky ground. Investors are calling this a 'valuation reset,' but honestly? It looks like a reality check.",
