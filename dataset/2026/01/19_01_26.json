    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, if you thought AI was just a gimmick on your phone, Samsung is about to prove you wrong. They just announced they are doubling their AI-powered devices to hit 800 million units this year. That is an insane number! We're talking about embedding Google's Gemini models into literally everything—phones, tablets, maybe even your fridge. \n\nWhat’s wild is the strategy here. They aren't just selling hardware anymore; they are trying to brute-force AI adoption by putting it in nearly a billion pockets. This is basically the 'Galaxy AI' era, and it puts huge pressure on Apple to respond. If Samsung pulls this off, they might just win the AI hardware race by sheer volume alone.",

Yes, billion with a 'B'. \n\nHis argument? He says OpenAI wouldn't even exist without his original $38 million seed money and that they betrayed their nonprofit mission to chase profits with Microsoft. OpenAI is calling it 'unserious,' but honestly, this is going to be the legal battle of the decade. It’s not just about the money; it’s about who actually owns the history—and future—of AGI. If Elon wins, it could bankrupt the biggest AI company on earth.",

    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "This is probably the most important story no one is talking about enough. OpenAI just dropped $10 billion on a deal with Cerebras Systems. Why does this matter? Because they are buying 'Wafer-Scale' engines, not standard Nvidia GPUs. \n\nThese chips are huge—literally the size of a dinner plate—and they are insanely fast for running AI agents. But here's the crazy part: they secured 750 Megawatts of power. That is roughly 75% of a nuclear reactor's output! They are decoupling from Nvidia to build their own massive inference fleet. This tells us one thing: OpenAI is preparing for AI agents that run 24/7, and they need a completely different kind of hardware to do it.",

The 'iPhone Fold' is real, it's launching late 2026, and it’s targeting the ultra-luxury market—think $2,500+. It sounds like they are positioning it as an iPad Mini that fits in your pocket.
