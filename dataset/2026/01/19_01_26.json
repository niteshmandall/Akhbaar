They just announced they are doubling their AI-powered devices to hit 800 million units this year. That is an insane number! We're talking about embedding Google's Gemini models into literally everything\u2014phones, tablets, maybe even your fridge. What\u2019s wild is the strategy here. They aren't just selling hardware anymore; they are trying to brute-force AI adoption by putting it in nearly a billion pockets. This is basically the 'Galaxy AI' era, and it puts huge pressure on Apple to respond. If Samsung pulls this off, they might just win the AI hardware race by sheer volume alone.",

OpenAI is calling it 'unserious,' but honestly, this is going to be the legal battle of the decade. It\u2019s not just about the money; it\u2019s about who actually owns the history\u2014and future\u2014of AGI. If Elon wins, it could bankrupt the biggest AI company on earth.",

But here's the crazy part: they secured 750 Megawatts of power. That is roughly 75% of a nuclear reactor's output! They are decoupling from Nvidia to build their own massive inference fleet.
