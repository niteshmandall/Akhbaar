    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you're doing because NVIDIA just dropped a nuclear bomb on the tech industry at CES. Jensen Huang unveiled the 'Vera Rubin' platform, and honestly, the specs are terrifying. We're talking about a GPU with 336 billion transistors. But here's the wild part\u2014it's not just for Chatbots anymore. Jensen is calling this a simulation engine for 'Physical AI.' Basically, they've built a rack-scale computer that acts as a single super-brain to simulate the laws of physics. Why? So robots can learn how to move in the real world without actually breaking things. They're moving from just generating text to simulating reality itself. If you thought the H100 was crazy, the Rubin architecture is about to make everything else look like a pocket calculator. This is the infrastructure for the next ten years of AI.",

    "raw_text": "You need to pay attention to this story because it changes the entire AI war. While the US is trying to ban chips sent to China, a Chinese startup called DeepSeek just pulled an 'Uno Reverse' card. They published a paper on a new training method called 'mHC'\u2014Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections. I know, it sounds like Star Trek techno-babble, but here's the translation: They figured out the math to make AI models way smarter without needing massive, unstable amounts of raw compute. They basically used a mathematical trick from the 1960s to stabilize the training process. The analysts are calling this 'Math beats Silicon.' It suggests that even with chip sanctions, China might just out-code the hardware limitations. This is a massive wake-up call for Silicon Valley.",

The government needs to guarantee that we have domestic factories for military and AI chips, and they aren't trusting the free market to get it done anymore. Intel also launched their new 'Panther Lake' chips to fight off Apple and AMD, but frankly, the tech is secondary to the politics here.
