    "summary": "Nvidia has entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq valued at approximately $20 billion, gaining access to Groq's LPU architecture and compiler stack. The deal includes an 'acqui-hire' of Groq's engineering team and founder Jonathan Ross to solve Nvidia's inference latency bottlenecks.",

    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you're doing. This is the biggest chess move we've seen in hardware this year. Nvidia just dropped twenty billion dollars\u2014yes, with a B\u2014to license Groq\u2019s technology. If you\u2019ve been following the chip wars, you know Groq is the company that makes those insanely fast LPU chips that make AI respond instantly. Here\u2019s the wild part: it\u2019s technically a 'licensing deal' to keep the antitrust regulators off their backs, but they\u2019re basically acquiring the brainpower. Groq\u2019s founder, Jonathan Ross, is moving to Nvidia. Jensen Huang isn\u2019t just happy winning the training game; he wants to own the inference game too. This effectively kills the 'Nvidia is too slow for real-time voice' argument. If you're betting against Nvidia right now, good luck.",

Imagine telling your AI, 'Buy me a red sweater under $50,' and instead of just showing you links, it actually goes to a Shopify store, puts it in the cart, and buys it\u2014completely on its own. They\u2019re doing this to fight Amazon. Amazon wants you trapped in their app; Google and Shopify want the entire open web to be shoppable by AI.
