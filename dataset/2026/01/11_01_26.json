It's called Alpamayo, and it\u2019s basically a brain transplant for autonomous cars. Jensen Huang revealed this beast at CES, and here's the wild part: it doesn't just 'see' the road\u2014it literally *thinks* about it. We're talking 'System 2' reasoning, guys. If a ball rolls into the street, old AI would just slam the brakes. Alpamayo actually generates an internal monologue like, 'I see a ball, physics says a kid probably kicked it, so I better watch for a toddler running out.' It\u2019s the difference between a reflex and an actual thought. They're even open-sourcing the data! This is the 'ChatGPT moment' for physical robots.
