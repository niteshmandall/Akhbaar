    "summary": "Meta Platforms' acquisition of Singapore-based AI startup Manus has triggered a national security probe by China's Ministry of Commerce. The conflict centers on 'Agentic AI' technology and the potential brain drain of Chinese engineering talent to a US giant.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "You guys, the AI wars just got real, and I'm not talking about chatbots. Meta just dropped a massive $2 billion to acquire Manus, an AI agent startup. But here is the wild part—Manus was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs, and Beijing is absolutely losing it. They just launched a massive probe into the deal, basically claiming that the 'agentic' algorithms and the talent behind them are sovereign assets. It is literally a tug-of-war for the brains behind the next generation of AI. If China blocks this, it sets a crazy precedent that AI talent is now property of the state. This is geopolitical drama at its peak.",

Honestly, this is huge because it changes the entire internet business model from 'search and click' to 'ask and receive.' Amazon should be very, very nervous right now.",

It's a mimicry of thinking, not actual thinking. They call it a 'cargo cult' of intelligence. It looks thorough, but under the hood, it's just probability.
