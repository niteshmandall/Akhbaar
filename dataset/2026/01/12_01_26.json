They just launched a massive probe into the deal, basically claiming that the 'agentic' algorithms and the talent behind them are sovereign assets. It is literally a tug-of-war for the brains behind the next generation of AI. If China blocks this, it sets a crazy precedent that AI talent is now property of the state.
