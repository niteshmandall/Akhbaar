    "title": "OpenAI's 'Sweetpea' Leaked: The Screenless iPhone Killer?",
    "summary": "Leaks reveal OpenAI's secret hardware project 'Sweetpea,' a screenless, ear-worn AI device designed by Jony Ive. Powered by a custom 2nm Samsung chip, it aims to replace smartphones with 'always-on' ambient intelligence.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, this is the leak we've been waiting for. We finally have details on the Jony Ive and Sam Altman hardware collaboration, and it is wild. It's codenamed 'Sweetpea,' and here is the kicker: it has no screen. None. It's a high-end, pebble-shaped wearable that sits behind your ear, and it's powered by a massive 2nm custom chip. \n\nThey are basically trying to kill the iPhone addiction. Instead of scrolling TikTok, this thing listens to your life and handles tasks for you in the background. It's the 'Context Economy' versus the 'Attention Economy.' Rumors say it's going to cost between $500 and $800. Would you pay flagship phone money for a device that you can't even look at? Honestly, it sounds like the movie 'Her' is finally happening. This is either going to be the biggest flop or the death of the smartphone.",

    "raw_text": "If you've been trying to buy the Ray-Ban Metas, you know they are impossible to find. Well, now we know why. Demand is so high that Meta is literally doubling their production capacity to 20 million units. They've even paused international rollouts just to keep the US stocked. \n\nThis is the first time an AR product has actually hit 'viral' status. But wait, it gets better. Meta just quietly bought an AI startup called Manus for over $2 billion. Why? Because they want these glasses to stop just being cameras and start being *agents* that can do things for you.

    "raw_text": "Bad news for Android fans. Samsung officially delayed the Galaxy S26. We usually get this phone in January, but now we have to wait until March 11th. And the reason is kind of terrifying: AI is eating all the chips. \n\nBecause NVIDIA and OpenAI need so much memory for their data centers, there isn't enough RAM left for smartphones. Supply and demand kicks in, and now the S26 is going to be more expensive. This is the first time we've seen the 'AI Boom' actually hurt the consumer gadget market directly.

They're just moving to the dark web, Discord servers, and unmoderated platforms where the government can't see them. Meta is basically saying 'We told you so.'
