    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, the numbers coming out of OpenAI today are absolutely insane. We\u2019re talking about $20 billion in annual revenue. That is a 10x jump from 2023. They are officially printing money, and it\u2019s not just ChatGPT subscriptions anymore\u2014it\u2019s big enterprise APIs. But here is the catch, and it\u2019s a massive one: the energy cost. To make that money, OpenAI is burning through 1.9 gigawatts of power. That is roughly the energy consumption of 1.5 million American homes. We\u2019ve been talking about the energy bottleneck for years, but seeing it in black and white like this is staggering. They are burning $17 billion a year just to keep the lights on. So, while they\u2019re winning the revenue game, the physics of this business model are getting scary. We are fast approaching a point where AI doesn't just need more chips; it needs its own nuclear power plant.",

By buying them, Nvidia just checkmated the entire industry. They now own the training stack with their GPUs and the inference stack with Groq\u2019s tech. This is a vertical monopoly on the physics of intelligence. Regulators are going to lose their minds over this, but from a tech perspective? It\u2019s brilliant.
