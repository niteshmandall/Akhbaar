    "summary": "OpenAI has surpassed $20 billion in annual recurring revenue, largely driven by enterprise API usage, but is now consuming 1.9 gigawatts of power annually.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, the numbers coming out of OpenAI today are absolutely insane. We’re talking about $20 billion in annual revenue. That is a 10x jump from 2023. They are officially printing money, and it’s not just ChatGPT subscriptions anymore—it’s big enterprise APIs. But here is the catch, and it’s a massive one: the energy cost. To make that money, OpenAI is burning through 1.9 gigawatts of power. That is roughly the energy consumption of 1.5 million American homes. We’ve been talking about the energy bottleneck for years, but seeing it in black and white like this is staggering. They are burning $17 billion a year just to keep the lights on. So, while they’re winning the revenue game, the physics of this business model are getting scary. We are fast approaching a point where AI doesn't just need more chips; it needs its own nuclear power plant.",

    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Just when you thought Nvidia couldn't get any more dominant, Jensen Huang goes and drops $20 billion to buy Groq. If you follow chip tech, you know Groq was supposed to be the 'Nvidia Killer' for inference—basically running the AI models after they're trained. Their LPU chips are crazy fast. By buying them, Nvidia just checkmated the entire industry. They now own the training stack with their GPUs and the inference stack with Groq’s tech. This is a vertical monopoly on the physics of intelligence. Regulators are going to lose their minds over this, but from a tech perspective? It’s brilliant. Nvidia isn't just a hardware company anymore; they are the gatekeepers of AI compute. If you're a competitor like AMD or Intel, this is your worst nightmare coming true.",

We’re seeing reports of massive battery drain and overheating because the ray-tracing effects are just too heavy for older iPhones. But the bigger story here is the pivot. To save face, Apple is rushing out iOS 26.4, and leaks confirm they are integrating Google’s Gemini models to power Siri. Let that sink in. Apple, the company that prides itself on vertical integration, is forced to rent intelligence from their biggest rival, Google, because their own AI isn't ready. It’s a huge admission of defeat in the AI wars. Your next Siri request is going to be processed by Google servers. It’s the end of an era for Apple's walled garden.",

    "engagement": "Medium",
    "raw_text": "We are officially moving from 'Chatbots' to 'Boss Bots.' Leaks from Anthropic show a new feature called 'Claude Code Swarms,' and it is wild. Instead of just talking to one AI, you give a goal to a 'Manager' agent, and it spins up a team of sub-agents. You’ve got a 'Product Owner' that checks scope, an 'Architect' that writes the specs, and a 'Dev Pair' that writes the code. It’s literally recreating a software engineering team inside the silicon. People are already using this to port legacy codebases with zero human intervention. This validates everything we’ve suspected: the future isn't one giant smart model; it’s a swarm of specialized agents working together. The cost is high—like 10x normal usage—but for enterprise work?

Forensic analysis shows this thing was built by an AI. A human just gave it the high-level goals—'I need a Linux rootkit, here are the specs'—and the AI wrote the code in Zig, handled the memory management, and even wrote its own testing protocols. It’s incredibly stealthy and efficient. This means the skill barrier for cybercrime just collapsed. You don't need to be a master hacker anymore; you just need to be a good prompt engineer.

If the deal goes through, he makes money. If he blocks it, he flexes power. It’s a massive conflict of interest playing out in real-time.

For context, the iPhone 16 Pro Max was around 4600mAh. They achieved this using a silicon-carbon anode, which holds way more energy than standard graphite. This is huge for foldables because usually, those phones have terrible battery life due to space constraints. Now, you can have a thin foldable that actually outlasts a brick phone.

They look exactly like normal 2x4 bricks, but they have sensors and wireless charging inside. If you swoosh a spaceship, it makes engine noises. If you put a baby duck brick near a mama duck brick, they quack. It works via a private Bluetooth mesh network. I love this because it’s not about staring at an iPad; it enhances the physical building experience. They’re rolling it out with Star Wars sets first—of course—so expect lightsabers that actually hum when you swing them.
