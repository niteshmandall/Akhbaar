Jensen Huang walked out and revealed the 'Rubin' platform, and this isn't just another chip upgrade\u2014it's practically a new species of supercomputer. We are talking about the new 'Vera' CPU and the 'Rubin' GPU, which uses HBM4 memory. That\u2019s 288 gigabytes of memory with bandwidths that are frankly ridiculous. But here is the wild part that matters to us: they aren't just chasing speed; they are chasing 'Physical AI.' They launched something called Alpamayo, which is a Vision-Language-Action model. Basically, it\u2019s an AI that doesn't just chat; it sees the world and plans physical actions, like driving cars or controlling robots, with chain-of-thought reasoning. They claim this platform drops inference costs by 10x. If that\u2019s true, we are about to see AI agents everywhere, doing everything, for pennies. This is the moment AI leaves the chatbox and enters the real world.",
