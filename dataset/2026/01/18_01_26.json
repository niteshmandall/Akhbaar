    "summary": "Elon Musk has filed a massive lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, demanding $134 billion in 'disgorgement' of wrongful gains. Musk claims OpenAI's shift from a non-profit to a for-profit entity defrauded early donors.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, grab your popcorn because the tech drama of the decade just dropped. Elon Musk is officially suing OpenAI and Microsoft, and he's not asking for pocket change\u2014he wants $134 billion. Yes, billion with a B. His argument is actually pretty wild: he's saying that OpenAI was founded as a non-profit to save humanity, and by turning it into a for-profit money printer for Microsoft, they pulled a massive bait-and-switch on early donors like him. He calls it 'disgorgement of wrongful gains.' It\u2019s going to trial in April 2026, and if Elon wins, it could literally break OpenAI's valuation. This isn't just a lawsuit; it's a battle for who actually controls the future of AGI.",
