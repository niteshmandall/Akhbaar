    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because the biggest wall in tech just crumbled. We\u2019ve been complaining for years that Siri is... well, dumb. And Apple apparently heard us. They just signed a massive deal to put Google's Gemini AI directly inside your iPhone. This is wild because Apple hates relying on competitors, right? But clearly, they needed a heavy hitter to compete with ChatGPT, and they needed it yesterday. So, later this year, when you ask Siri a complex question, it\u2019s not going to give you that annoying 'Here\u2019s what I found on the web' nonsense. It\u2019s going to use Google\u2019s massive cloud infrastructure to actually reason and answer you. It's a huge win for Google, but honestly, I'm just happy my $1,200 phone might finally be as smart as a free chatbot. This changes the entire mobile landscape.",
