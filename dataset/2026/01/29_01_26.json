    "summary": "OpenAI has launched Prism, a dedicated research workspace powered by GPT-5.2 that integrates LaTeX and scientific writing tools. The platform allows for unlimited projects and features a 'thinking' mode for complex reasoning, aiming to replace traditional academic editors.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because OpenAI might have just changed how we write forever. They just dropped a new tool called 'Prism,' and honestly, it looks like a Google Docs killer for anyone doing serious work. \n\nHere is the wild part: It’s not just a chat window. It is a full-blown workspace running on GPT-5.2—yeah, the new model—and it is designed specifically for research and science. You can literally sketch a diagram on a napkin, upload it, and Prism converts it into perfect LaTeX code. It has a 'thinking mode' where it actually reasons through your logic before writing. \n\nIf you are a student or a researcher, this is huge. They are basically trying to verticalize the entire scientific workflow. It's free for personal accounts right now, so go check it out before they lock it behind a paywall. Is this the end of Overleaf? Let me know in the comments.",

No more wandering around your house hearing a faint beep coming from inside the couch cushions—you will actually be able to hear this thing.\n\nBut that’s not even the best part. It’s got the new Ultra-Wideband chip from the iPhone 17 Pro, which means the precision finding range is way better. You can track your keys from almost twice the distance now. They also added a 'Share Item Location' feature so you can finally let the airline help you find your lost luggage directly. It’s dropping at $29. Are you upgrading or sticking with the old ones?",

Amazon just confirmed they are cutting 16,000 corporate jobs in something they call 'Project Dawn.'\n\nHere is the scary part: They are explicitly targeting middle management to 'flatten' the hierarchy. At the exact same time, they are spending massive amounts of money on AI infrastructure. The message is pretty clear—they want to be leaner and let AI handle the coordination that managers used to do. Investors are loving it, the stock is up, but for the workforce? This is a brutal signal for 2026. Is your job safe from this kind of 'efficiency'? Let's discuss.",

It learned. They used a single neural network that takes in video and outputs movement. That means if you move the cup slightly, the robot adjusts instantly—just like a human would. This 'pixels-to-actions' tech is the holy grail for getting robots into our homes. We are looking at a future where your butler is basically an AI vision model with arms.

They swapped it for Alibaba's Qwen model. This isn't just about performance—though they say it's 3% better—it's about survival.
