    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because OpenAI might have just changed how we write forever. They just dropped a new tool called 'Prism,' and honestly, it looks like a Google Docs killer for anyone doing serious work. Here is the wild part: It\u2019s not just a chat window. It is a full-blown workspace running on GPT-5.2\u2014yeah, the new model\u2014and it is designed specifically for research and science. You can literally sketch a diagram on a napkin, upload it, and Prism converts it into perfect LaTeX code. It has a 'thinking mode' where it actually reasons through your logic before writing. If you are a student or a researcher, this is huge. They are basically trying to verticalize the entire scientific workflow. It's free for personal accounts right now, so go check it out before they lock it behind a paywall. Is this the end of Overleaf? Let me know in the comments.",
