    "summary": "Anthropic has released 'Claude Cowork,' an OS-level AI agent capable of operating directly within the macOS file system to execute tasks autonomously. Unlike a chatbot, it runs in a secure sandbox to read, edit, and organize files without constant user prompting.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because the way we use computers just changed. Anthropic just dropped 'Claude Cowork,' and it is not just another chatbot window. This thing lives in your operating system. It's an OS-level agent. Imagine giving an instruction like 'organize my entire downloads folder' or 'read these 300 PDFs and write a summary,' and instead of chatting back at you, it just... does it. It literally moves files, edits documents, and executes plans. It's built on a virtual machine sandbox so it doesn't accidentally delete your hard drive, which is a relief. Honestly, this is the 'Jarvis' moment we've been waiting for. It\u2019s moving from talking to AI to letting AI actually drive the computer. Productivity is about to get wild.",

But the second you ask Siri something complex\u2014like 'plan a vacation' or 'debug this code'\u2014it hands off the brainpower to Google Gemini in the cloud. It\u2019s a huge win for Google and a necessary survival move for Apple. Siri might finally stop being... well, Siri. But does this mean Google owns the AI layer on every phone now?",

Analysts are calling it a 'striking breakthrough.' It basically proves you don't just need a trillion-dollar data center to win at AI; you can out-engineer the problem.
