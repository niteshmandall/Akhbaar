    "raw_text": "Okay, stop scrolling because the streaming wars are officially over. Netflix just dropped a massive bomb—they are acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery for nearly $83 billion. We're talking HBO, the DC Universe, and the entire Warner Bros. film studio now living under the Netflix banner. Basically, the 'forever library' is here. What’s wild is how they structured this. They are literally taking the 'good stuff'—the streaming hits and prestige TV—and splitting off the dying cable networks like CNN and TNT into a totally separate company. It’s brutal but smart. This creates a content monopoly that feels almost illegal, and honestly, regulators are already sharpening their knives. But for us? It means Batman and Stranger Things are technically under the same roof. Is this the ultimate super-platform or a terrifying monopoly? Let me know in the comments.",

    "raw_text": "If you thought the AI hype was dying down, you were wrong. Google just scared OpenAI so bad that Sam Altman declared an internal 'Code Red.' Why? Because Google dropped Gemini 3 with 'Deep Think' technology, and it was actually beating GPT-4. So, OpenAI panic-launched GPT-5.2 way ahead of schedule. Here’s the breakdown: GPT-5.2 isn't just a chatbot anymore. It has a 'Thinking' variant that pauses to verify its own logic before answering, and a new 'Context Compaction' feature that lets it remember up to 400,000 tokens—that's like whole novels—without getting slow or expensive. We are officially leaving the era of 'chatbots' and entering the era of 'reasoning engines.' The big question is: Are we ready for AI that takes time to think before it speaks?",
