    "raw_text": "Okay, stop scrolling because the numbers we are seeing today are absolutely insane. OpenAI is reportedly looking to raise a fresh $100 billion. Yes, billion with a 'B'. And the valuation? They are aiming for $830 billion. We are inching dangerously close to the first trillion-dollar AI startup. To put that in perspective, that is bigger than the GDP of most countries. But here is the catch\u2014reports suggest this is heavily fueled by what analysts are calling a 'circular economy.' Basically, tech giants invest billions, and OpenAI turns around and spends that money on those same giants' cloud servers. Is this sustainable growth or the biggest bubble in history? Honestly, with GPT-5.2 out and the burn rate hitting $14 billion a year, they need this cash just to keep the lights on. It\u2019s a high-stakes gamble on AGI.",

That means local LLMs like Gemini Nano are baked into the system level\u2014indexing your files, predicting what apps you need, and basically running your digital life locally.
