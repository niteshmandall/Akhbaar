    "raw_text": "Okay, stop scrolling because the AI wars just went nuclear. OpenAI just dropped GPT-5.2, and the benchmarks are honestly terrifying\u2014in a good way. We're talking about a perfect score on the AIME math benchmark and a massive 38% drop in hallucinations. Basically, it stops making things up. But here\u2019s the tea: this release was rushed out as a 'code red' because Google's Gemini 3 was getting too good. They\u2019ve split it into three modes: Instant for speed, Thinking for deep reasoning, and Pro for the heavy lifting. If you\u2019re a dev or a creator, the 'Thinking' mode is what you need to watch\u2014it\u2019s designed specifically for complex coding and long-context reasoning. The gap is widening again, folks.",
