    "summary": "Google has released Gemini 3 Flash, a new AI model that achieves frontier-level intelligence while being 3x faster and significantly cheaper than previous iterations. It scores 90.4% on PhD-level benchmarks and is designed to reset the cost-performance ratio for developers.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because Google just completely flipped the script on the AI wars. They launched Gemini 3 Flash, and the specs are honestly ridiculous. We're talking about a model that is matching\u2014and in some cases beating\u2014the massive 'Pro' models we're used to, but it's doing it at three times the speed. Here's the wild part: they've optimized the 'thinking levels' so it uses 30% fewer tokens for regular stuff but can ramp up compute when you ask it something hard. It\u2019s scoring over 90% on PhD-level reasoning benchmarks! For developers, this is the holy grail because the pricing is aggressively low\u201450 cents per million input tokens. If you're building apps, your costs just plummeted. OpenAI has been quiet lately, but this? This is Google throwing a massive gauntlet down. The speed-to-intelligence ratio here is actually frightening.",
