    "raw_text": "Guys, the AI wars just got absolutely brutal. OpenAI is officially in panic mode. Sam Altman just declared a 'Code Red' internally. Why? Because Google just dropped Gemini 3, and it is crushing everything. We're talking a score of 1501 on LMArena—the first model to ever cross that line—and over 90% on PhD reasoning tasks. It's honestly embarrassing for GPT-4 at this point. OpenAI is reportedly scrapping their plans for ad integrations and shopping bots just to focus on getting GPT-5.2 out the door by... wait for it... TODAY, December 9th. If you thought the AI hype was dying down, you were wrong. It's just getting started.",
