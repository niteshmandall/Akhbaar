    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, this is absolutely massive. Disney just officially ended the war against AI. Instead of suing OpenAI, they just dropped a cool ONE BILLION dollars to buy a stake in the company. But here is the wild part: they are licensing their entire library—Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, everything—directly into Sora. Imagine typing 'Iron Man fighting Darth Vader' and getting an official, high-fidelity clip generated instantly. They’ve drawn a line in the sand though: no deepfaking human actors. But for animators and VFX artists? This is a game-changer, and frankly, a little terrifying for the industry. The 'Clean AI' era is here, and Disney is building the moat.",

We're talking about a focus on 'reasoning' and 'reliability'—basically trying to prove they are still the kings of the hill. If you thought things were slowing down, you're wrong.
