    "summary": "Xiaomi has released MiMo-V2-Flash, a Mixture-of-Experts model with 309 billion parameters that uses only 15 billion active parameters for inference. Early benchmarks suggest it rivals DeepSeek V3.2 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in mathematical reasoning and coding tasks.",

    "raw_text": "Okay, this is actually wild. Xiaomi\u2014yes, the phone company\u2014just dropped a massive 309-billion parameter AI model called MiMo-V2-Flash. But here\u2019s the kicker: it only uses 15 billion active parameters during inference. Why does that matter? Because it means you could theoretically run flagship-level AI on high-end consumer GPUs without needing a massive data center. They\u2019re claiming it beats DeepSeek V3.2 in math and coding. If this benchmark holds up, the open-source AI race just got a new front-runner, and it's all about efficiency over raw size. I\u2019m going to need to test this on my rig ASAP to see if the hype is real.",
