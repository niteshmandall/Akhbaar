Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, just merged with TAE Technologies\u2014a nuclear fusion startup\u2014in a massive six-billion-dollar deal. Yeah, you heard that right. A social media company is buying a fusion reactor company. Why? One word: AI. We all know AI factories are absolutely guzzling electricity, and the bet here is that fusion energy is going to be the only way to keep up with the demand. The market went absolutely nuts on this news, with the stock jumping 42% in a single day. Jensen Huang has been warning us that energy is the 'hard cap' on AI scaling, and it looks like DJT is trying to corner that market. They\u2019re planning to break ground on a utility-scale plant by 2026. This is basically the birth of the 'AI-Industrial Complex' right before our eyes. Is it a bubble or the smartest pivot in tech history? Let me know what you think in the comments.",
