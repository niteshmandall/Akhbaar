    "summary": "Amazon has entered advanced negotiations to invest $10 billion into OpenAI, following a confirmed $38 billion cloud services agreement. This partnership signals the end of Microsoft's exclusive infrastructure hegemony over OpenAI and introduces Amazon's Trainium chips as a competitor to Nvidia.",

    "raw_text": "You guys, the tech landscape just shifted beneath our feet. For years, we thought OpenAI and Microsoft were inseparable, right? Well, that marriage is officially on the rocks. Reports confirm Amazon is dropping a massive $48 billion total commitment\u2014including a $10 billion direct injection\u2014into OpenAI. But here is the wild part: OpenAI is actually going to use Amazon's proprietary 'Trainium' chips. This is a direct shot at Nvidia's monopoly. We are seeing the 'Switzerland of AI' strategy from AWS finally pay off. If you're Microsoft, you have to be sweating right now. This isn't just about money; it's about compute power and breaking free from vendor lock-in. The era of the single-cloud AI giant is over.",

Sam Altman basically admitted that Gemini scared them. This is the AI arms race in real-time. If you're a Plus user, you need to test the 'Thinking' variant immediately.
