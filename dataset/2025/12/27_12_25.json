According to reports dropping today, a new feature has been spotted on their support pages that lets you swap your primary address without losing all your emails or creating a totally new account. Your old address just becomes an alias, so you still get your mail. This is huge for anyone trying to look professional without nuking their entire digital life. It's currently spotting in specific regions, but expect a massive rollout soon. Honestly, this might be the best feature Google has released all year.",
