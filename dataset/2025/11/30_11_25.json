    "summary": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced an aggressive infrastructure expansion plan, aiming for a data center network costing up to $1.4 trillion by 2033. The move signals a shift from a research lab to a massive infrastructure operator to support next-gen AI models.",
    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, strap in because Sam Altman just dropped a bombshell that honestly sounds like science fiction. He's calling for a 'very aggressive' infrastructure bet that could see OpenAI spending up to $400 billion by 2029 and a staggering $1.4 trillion by 2033. We are talking about building the largest data center network in human history. Altman literally called the scale 'ridiculously terrifying.' Why? Because they believe there's a huge 'capability overhang'—basically, they have models way smarter than what we're seeing, but they physically can't run them for everyone yet. This isn't just a tech upgrade; it's OpenAI trying to become the backbone of the entire future economy. If this happens, the compute power involved is going to be mind-boggling.",

OpenAI just capped free Sora users to six videos a day, and Google slashed Nano Banana Pro usage to just two images. The head of the Sora team, Bill Peebles, didn't mince words on X—he literally said, 'Our GPUs are melting.' This is crazy. It shows that demand for generative AI is growing faster than the physical hardware can handle. It looks like the days of unlimited free AI playgrounds are ending, and we're moving into a 'pay-to-play' era because the electricity and cooling costs are just getting too astronomical.",

They simulated the entire U.S. economy using AI agents and found that 11.7% of the workforce can be replaced right now. That is $1.2 trillion in wages. And get this—it's not blue-collar jobs. The biggest hit is to 'Finance & Administration.' We're talking auditors, analysts, and compliance officers. The report calls it the 'submerged' part of the iceberg because everyone is focused on tech layoffs, but the real displacement is happening in boring back-office jobs across the country.

Because of a software bug, the plane didn't just reset; it actually acted on that corrupted data. Now, Airbus has to recall or update 6,000 A320s immediately. It's wild to think that a solar flare can reach down and mess with physical flight controls, but here we are.
