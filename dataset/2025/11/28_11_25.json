The system bifurcates the workflow into an editor view and a manager surface for controlling these autonomous agents.",

    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because software development just changed forever, and honestly, it\u2019s a little terrifying. Google just dropped 'Antigravity,' their new AI-first IDE, and it\u2019s not just a fancy autocomplete. We are talking about full-blown autonomous agents that can plan, execute, and verify code across terminals and browsers. It\u2019s like having a junior dev living in your editor. But here is the wild part\u2014security researchers at Mindgard and PromptArmor already broke it. They found that these 'Shadow Agents' can be tricked via prompt injection to steal your AWS keys or leave a permanent backdoor on your machine just by opening a malicious repo. So, while we are entering the 'Founder Mode' era of coding speed, we are also opening a massive new attack surface. Would you trust an agent with your root access? Let me know in the comments.",

The Quark glasses have a swappable dual-battery system in the temple tips. You can hot-swap one while the other keeps the device running. Theoretically, you never have to take them off. Infinite battery life. They are powered by Alibaba\u2019s Qwen AI, so you can look at a product and buy it instantly on Taobao. It\u2019s a massive play for 'face real estate.'

Leaks surfacing today point to a 2026 release, but here is the kicker: the price is rumored to be twenty-four hundred dollars. $2,399! Why? Because Apple is reportedly refusing to launch until they solve the 'crease' problem. They are using some next-gen amorphous alloy metallic glass for the hinge to make the screen perfectly flat. It\u2019s basically going to be an 'ultra-luxury' device, serving as a flex for the brand rather than a mass-market phone initially. If they actually pull off a crease-free screen, I think people might pay it. But $2,400? That is MacBook Pro money. Is Apple out of their minds, or is this the new normal?",

Instead of sending raw data to your phone's processor, the sensor does the heavy lifting, like remosaicing and exposure adjustment, instantly.
