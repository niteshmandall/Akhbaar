    "raw_text": "Guys, Google just woke up and chose violence. They dropped Gemini 3 today, and they are not holding back. Sundar Pichai is calling it the 'best model in the world for multimodal understanding,' but here's the wild part you need to know about: 'Deep Think' mode. It's basically their answer to OpenAI's o1, where the model actually pauses to reason before it spits out an answer. But for my developers out there, the real game-changer is something they call 'Vibe Coding.' I kid you not. It understands the 'gestalt' of your code\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe implicit style and intent\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso you don't have to write perfect prompts anymore. It just gets it. Honestly, this is huge.
