They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve introduced something called 'Deep Think' mode. Unlike previous AIs that just guess the next word, this thing actually pauses to 'think' recursively. It spawns multiple thought paths, checks its own logic, and corrects itself before it even answers you. Think of it like System 2 thinking for machines. Plus, for my devs out there, they added 'Vibe Coding.' You don't need perfect syntax anymore; you just describe the 'vibe' or intent of the app, and it handles the boilerplate. Is this the GPT-killer we've been waiting for? Let me know in the comments.",
