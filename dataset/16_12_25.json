    "summary": "The Walt Disney Company has secured a $1 billion equity stake in OpenAI, forming a strategic partnership to integrate Disney's vast IP library into the Sora video platform. The deal allows for the creation of AI-generated content using over 200 masked or animated characters like Iron Man and Mickey Mouse, while explicitly excluding human likenesses to avoid conflict with actor guilds.",

    "raw_text": "Okay, this is absolutely massive news that changes everything for entertainment. Disney just dropped a cool one billion dollars\u2014yes, billion with a B\u2014to buy a stake in OpenAI. But here\u2019s the wild part: they are officially putting Mickey Mouse, Iron Man, and Star Wars characters into Sora. Before you panic, they\u2019ve drawn a pretty interesting line in the sand. They are strictly using 'masked' and animated characters. So, AI Iron Man is a go, but AI Robert Downey Jr. is a hard no. It\u2019s a genius, albeit scary, move to monetize their IP without technically replacing human actors' faces. While they are suing Google for copyright infringement on one hand, they\u2019re paying OpenAI on the other. This is the 'contain and monetize' strategy in full effect. The content wars are over, folks\u2014Disney just bought the nukes.",

If you've ever tried to get an AI to do actual, deep research\u2014like browsing dozens of sites and compiling a report\u2014you know it usually hallucinates halfway through. Google claims this new 'Deep Think' mode fixes that by optimizing for long-running, multi-step tasks. They even released a new benchmark called 'Humanity's Last Exam' just to prove how smart it is. This is clearly a race to see who can build the first true 'Agent' that works autonomously. If this thing actually works as advertised inside Google Finance and NotebookLM, it\u2019s going to save us all hours of work.",
