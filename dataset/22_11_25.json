    "summary": "Google has launched Gemini 3.0, featuring a new \"Deep Think\" recursive reasoning capability that allows the model to self-correct before answering. Early benchmarks show it outperforming GPT-5.1 on complex tasks, introducing \"Vibe Coding\" to lower the barrier for software development.",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because Google just dropped Gemini 3.0, and honestly? The benchmarks are looking absolutely insane. We are moving from just 'predicting the next word' to actual recursive reasoning. They've introduced this 'Deep Think' mode where the model literally spawns multiple internal thought trajectories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dkind of like Dr. Strange looking at potential futures\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbefore it gives you an answer. \n\nBut here is the feature that's going to break the internet for developers: 'Vibe Coding.' You don't even need to write perfect prompts anymore. You just describe the 'vibe' or intent of the app you want, and Gemini infers the structural boilerplate. It scored a 37.5% on the 'Humanity's Last Exam' benchmark, which sounds terrifying, but it smoked GPT-5.1's 26.5%. Google is officially done playing catch-up; they are trying to reclaim the throne right now. If you're a dev or just an AI nerd, you need to try this immediately.",

    "raw_text": "OpenAI isn't letting Google have all the fun today. They just pushed GPT-5.1, and they've finally split the experience into two lanes: 'Instant' for when you need speed, and 'Thinking' for when you need the heavy lifting. But the real game-changer here is for the coders. They dropped 'Codex Max,' which uses something called 'compaction' to remember context across millions of tokens. \n\nBasically, they claim this thing can debug and refactor code for 24 hours straight without you holding its hand. That is autonomous employment, folks. And just to make sure they have the compute to back this up, they signed a jaw-dropping $38 billion deal with AWS. Yes, billion with a 'B.' They are locking down hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. The AI arms race just went nuclear, and OpenAI is bringing the heavy artillery.",
