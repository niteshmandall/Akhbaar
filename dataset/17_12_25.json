    "summary": "Google has officially launched Gemini 3, featuring a new \"Deep Think\" mode that utilizes a latent reasoning layer to verify intermediate steps and reduce hallucinations. The launch includes a Deep Research agent capable of autonomous web navigation, hypothesis formulation, and visual report generation.",

    "raw_text": "Stop what you're doing\u2014Google just changed the game. They've officially dropped Gemini 3, and this isn't just a speed upgrade. They've introduced something called 'Deep Think' mode. Basically, instead of just guessing the next word, the model now has a 'latent reasoning layer'\u2014it actually pauses to think, plans out its logic, and self-corrects before it even types a single letter. It's Google's answer to OpenAI's reasoning models, but integrated directly into the ecosystem. Plus, they launched a Deep Research agent that doesn't just search; it browses the web, finds missing info, and writes full reports with charts. The chatbot era is over; the agent era is here.",
