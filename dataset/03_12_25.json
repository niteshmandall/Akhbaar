    "engagement": "High",
    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because the entire AI landscape just shifted overnight. A Chinese lab called DeepSeek just dropped V3.2, and the stats are absolutely melting my brain. They managed to match GPT-5 and Gemini 3 performance levels\u2014we're talking top-tier reasoning and coding\u2014but here is the kicker: they reportedly did it for around 5.6 million dollars. Do you realize how insane that is? US companies are spending hundreds of millions, even billions, to get these results. DeepSeek used this new 'Sparse Attention' architecture to make it incredibly efficient. And the wildest part? It's open weights. Anyone can use this. This basically proves you don't need a trillion-dollar budget to build frontier AI anymore. The moat is gone, folks.",
