The model is rolling out immediately across Google's ecosystem in 120 countries, marking a significant counter-attack against OpenAI.",

    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you are doing because Google just stopped playing nice. They officially launched Gemini 3 today, and it is not just another chatbot update. The killer feature here is something called 'Generative UI.' Imagine asking for a travel itinerary, and instead of a wall of text, the AI literally codes and renders a custom interactive website for you on the fly with maps and buttons. That is wild! They also dropped a 'Deep Think' mode to rival OpenAI's reasoning models. After three years of chasing ChatGPT, Google is claiming they've finally regained the throne. I'm testing the 'vibe coding' feature right now, and honestly, the speed is terrifying. Is this the ChatGPT killer? Let me know in the comments.",
