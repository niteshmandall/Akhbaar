    "summary": "OpenAI has released GPT-5.2 with three variants: Instant, Thinking, and Pro, introducing 'inference-time reasoning' to reduce hallucinations. The model achieves a 70.9% score on the new GDPval benchmark, indicating it can perform nearly 71% of standardized economic tasks.",

    "raw_text": "Okay, stop what you're doing. OpenAI just dropped GPT-5.2, and this isn't just another chatbot update\u2014it's a fundamental shift. They've split the model into three brains: Instant, Thinking, and Pro. The 'Thinking' model is the real game-changer. It literally pauses to create a hidden 'chain of thought' before it answers you, which basically kills those annoying hallucinations we're used to. But here's the wild part: they introduced a new metric called 'GDPval.' It measures economic utility, not just test scores. GPT-5.2 scored nearly 71%, meaning it can theoretically do 71% of the tasks in a standard white-collar economy. We are officially leaving the 'chatbot' era and entering the 'digital labor' era. Honestly, this is huge.",

You know how you usually open ten tabs to book a trip\u2014flights, hotels, maps? Disco doesn't do that. It uses Gemini 3 to look at what you're trying to do and literally *codes* a custom app for you right there in the tab. It's called 'GenTabs.' You're not visiting websites anymore; you're visiting a Google-generated interface that pulls data *from* the websites. For us users? It's amazing. For publishers and website owners? It's an absolute nightmare. This is the 'Generative UI' revolution we've been hearing about.",
