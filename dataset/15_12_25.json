    "summary": "In a historic $1 billion deal, Disney has partnered with OpenAI to license over 200 characters (including Star Wars and Marvel) for use in the Sora video model[cite: 90, 111]. Simultaneously, Disney has issued cease-and-desist orders against Google for unauthorized use of its IP in the Veo and Imagen models[cite: 136, 140].",

    "raw_text": "You guys, the entertainment industry just changed forever. Disney—yes, the Mouse House—just dropped a massive one billion dollar investment into OpenAI. But here's the wild part: they aren't just writing a check. They are officially licensing over 200 of their biggest characters to be used in Sora. We're talking Star Wars, Marvel, and Mickey Mouse, all legally available inside OpenAI's video generator. Imagine generating your own Star Wars scenes that actually look official! But there's a catch—Disney is building a 'walled garden,' so this content will likely be exclusive to Disney+ or specific apps. And get this: at the exact same time, they are suing Google for 'hallucinating' Mickey Mouse in their AI models. It's a total power move: pay up like OpenAI, or get sued like Google. The AI copyright wars have officially begun.",

When you fully open this thing, you're holding a straight-up 10-inch tablet in your hands. It's running the new Snapdragon 8 Elite and has a massive battery to handle all that screen real estate. The coolest feature? You can run three full-sized portrait apps side-by-side. Imagine having Twitter, YouTube, and your group chat open all at once without squinting. It's pricey, it's flashy, and it's basically the ultimate mobile AI device. Is this the future of phones or just a flex? Let me know in the comments.",

They're claiming a 38% drop in hallucinations, which is huge if you're trying to use this for actual work. But the real headline is the new 'Thinking' mode. It's designed specifically for coding and complex math, basically allowing the AI to pause and reason before it answers—similar to what we've seen from other reasoning models. It looks like Sam Altman hit the 'code red' button to get this out because Google's Gemini 3 has been eating their lunch lately.

Usually, if a drone enters a restricted area, authorities just jam the GPS signal and it drops. But these new AI drones? They don't use GPS. They use 'visual odometry'—basically, they have onboard AI that 'sees' the world and navigates by landmarks, just like a human pilot (or a cruise missile). That means electronic jammers are totally useless against them. It's a massive security gap, and it shows how fast consumer AI hardware is outpacing actual defense tech.

It tracks object permanence, gravity, and collision better than anything else out there. It's currently ranked number one, beating out Sora and Google Veo.
